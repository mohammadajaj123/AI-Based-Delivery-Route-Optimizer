# AI-Based-Delivery-Route-Optimizer
Designed and implemented a smart delivery management system that assigns packages to vehicles and optimizes their routes using AI algorithms such as Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms.
Key Features:

Developed in Python, with visualization using Matplotlib

Modeled real-world constraints: vehicle capacity, package weight, priority, and distance

Automated route planning to minimize total travel distance and balance delivery loads

Visualized optimized delivery paths and computed per-vehicle statistics

Enabled user interaction for dynamic input of vehicles and packages

Evaluated algorithm efficiency and accuracy in real-time
